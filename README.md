# xqbs
XML based Qbs project definition.

Using XML and associated XSD as project structure for Qbs projects, it would be simpler defining new projects by the help of code-completion based on XSD. 
Maybe seen as a disadvantage, the scripts would be defined in stand-alone files reffered by project. Projects and scripts will be separated.
If it would be useful, common scripts could be translated in XML/XSD.
